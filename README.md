`pyston2d`, or `piston2d-python`, is a Python binding for the amazing Rust library `piston2d`.

*This is very WIP, so I will not accept any issues (yet). Assume that breaking changes happen with every commit.*

## Building
Use setuptools to build
```python
pip install setuptools wheel setuptools_rust
python setup.py install
```
